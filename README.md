# 🧠 Neovim Configuration

This is my personal Neovim configuration, designed for speed, usability, and modern development workflows. It includes useful plugins, clean UI customizations, and sensible defaults for an efficient coding experience.

## 🚀 Installation

To install this Neovim configuration, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OmarAlimammad/nvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
```


## 🗒️ Note

It is better to use a Nerd font like JetBrains Mono Nerd font as your terminal font.
